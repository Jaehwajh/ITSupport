## IT Support

## **Concept Full-Stack Application**

This is merely a concept. I previously worked as an IT Technician and always wanted to support my clients outside of work. There were times, where clients would ask me simple questions about their device or ask how they themselves can fix their devices. This concept application would be the tool that can help them out. An all in one IT support application where users can look up their devices or look up their issue and get a solution. It would give them all the necessary information, cause, and potential fix for their problem. Of course, since there are multiple reasons as to why a problem occured, this application will give the user multiple solutions and if it is determined that it cannot be fixed by the client, then the application will also let the user know to seek professional help. 

The goal of this application is to allow clients to try and fix their devices before going to a repair shop, potentially saving time and money for the user.
